Bulk Email Creator
A simple web application designed to generate multiple Outlook email drafts from a CSV file. This tool is perfect for sending personalized, one-off emails without the need for a full-scale mail merge program.

Features
CSV Integration: Automatically reads headers from your CSV file to create dynamic placeholders.

Dynamic Placeholders: Personalize your email subject and body using placeholders like {{Name}} or {{AccountNumber}}.

Bulk Generation: Creates a unique mailto link for each row in your CSV.

Convenient Actions:

Open Draft: Click a generated link to open a new email draft in your default email client (e.g., Outlook, Gmail).

Copy Link: Copy the raw mailto link to your clipboard.

Copy All Links: Copy all generated links to your clipboard at once.

Send All Drafts: Opens a new email draft for every recipient in a separate tab or window.

Variable Preview: Each generated email block includes a collapsible section that shows a list of the variables and their corresponding values used to create that specific email.

How to Use
Upload Your CSV: Click the "Upload your CSV file" button and select a file. The first row of your CSV must be the header row.

Select Recipient: From the dropdown menu, choose the column that contains the email addresses of your recipients.

Create Your Template: In the "Email Subject" and "Email Body" fields, write your template. Use the placeholders provided by the app (e.g., {{FirstName}}) to automatically insert data from your CSV.

Add Optional Columns: If your CSV contains data for CC, BCC, or attachments, you can specify the corresponding column names.

Generate Drafts: Click the Generate Email Drafts button. The application will process your data and create a list of clickable email links below.

Important Notes
Drafts, Not Sends: The links generated by this tool create drafts in your email client. They do not automatically send the emails. You must still review and click send for each email.

Attachment Handling: The mailto protocol does not support automatically attaching files. The "Attachments" field is for your reference only, to remind you which files to manually attach to each email.

URL Length Limit: mailto links have a length limit. If your CSV rows contain a very large amount of data or your email body is very long, some links may not function correctly.
